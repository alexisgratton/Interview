			<h3>1. Why do you want to be a designer?</h3>
			<p>I want to be a designer because I like to think it's something that I can do well, despite my initial lack of enthusiasm.</p>

			<h3>2. What is difficult or frustrating for you within design and how do you work to push past that?</h3>
			<p>Finding my own creativity with open ended concepts is one of my biggest hurdles in creating designs. I try to keep my inspiration strict and use those elements to move forwards.</p>

			<h3>3. Where do you see yourself doing after you finish this program?</h3>
			<p>If anything, I see myself probably going into something like copywriting or bring an editor after the fact. Design was a second choice for me. Writing is my preferred passion.</p>

			<h3>4. What excites you about design?</h3>
			<p>Well that's quite the open-ended question, what I find most "exciting" about design as a concept would mostly be the absolute wild things that the bowl of tapioca pudding, we call a brain can accomplish with just a few simple elements.</p>

			<h3>5. What worries you about design?</h3>
			<p>What worries me would be in a similar fashion to what excites me. With the rise of "modern" and "contemporary" design, nothing really seems fun anymore. Everything has to be sleek, and minimal, and it's just boring.</p>

			<h3>6. What is a website?</h3>
			<p>A website is a translation of numerous code inputs to present information between users through the internet. Can be made interesting or equally as bland through use of design elements.</p>
